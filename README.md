I am currently engaged in a project that involves using an AI tool to generate summaries and conduct analyses of a research paper. 
The focus of the paper is in the field of Social Sciences, specifically on summarizing and analyzing research regarding the 
effects of social media on mental health. This project aims to develop skills in crafting effective prompts, analyzing 
information, and applying insights.

To suggest potential applications or implications based on the research findings.
To evaluate the effectiveness of different prompts used in the process.
To reflect on the learning experience and enhance prompting and analytical skills.
